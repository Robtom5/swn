evolution:
  autocracy:
  - Anarchy! The government collapses. On a 4+ on 1d6, it is replaced by a Tribalism
    centered around individual settlements or kinship groupings. On 3 or less, zealous
    revolutionaries are successful in entrenching their own ideals; roll randomly
    on the government type table.
  - The government weathers the crisis without change.
  - The autocrat is overthrown by a popular uprising that rapidly degenerates into
    a Military Dictatorship as the strongest remaining military force seizes control.
  - The autocrat steps down out of conviction or weakness, resulting in a nascent
    Republic of opposition group leaders.
  - The autocrat loses control of his underlings as the government fragments into
    a Feudal array of independent bureau chiefs or warlords.
  - The autocrat seeks the legitimacy of religious support, but the government is
    consumed by the passions it provokes and becomes a Theocracy.
  corporatism:
  - Anarchy! The government collapses. On a 4+ on 1d6, it is replaced by a Tribalism
    centered around individual settlements or kinship groupings. On 3 or less, zealous
    revolutionaries are successful in entrenching their own ideals; roll randomly
    on the government type table.
  - The government weathers the crisis without change.
  - The corporate blocs crumble as old special interests and affiliation ties cease
    to have meaning. Their representatives are now elected in an effective Republic.
  - The elite of the corporate bodies entrench themselves as bureaucrats and executives
    over the population, becoming a self-perpetuating Technocracy.
  - The military evolves into its own corporate body, seizing control from the others
    to form a new Military Dictatorship.
  - One corporate body gradually becomes preeminent, forming the basis of an ongoing
    Autocracy.
  democracy:
  - Anarchy! The government collapses. On a 4+ on 1d6, it is replaced by a Tribalism
    centered around individual settlements or kinship groupings. On 3 or less, zealous
    revolutionaries are successful in entrenching their own ideals; roll randomly
    on the government type table.
  - The government weathers the crisis without change.
  - The population becomes too unwieldy or dispersed to participate in direct democracy
    any more, and the government becomes a Republic.
  - Special interest groups and economic classes harden their lines, transforming
    the democracy into a Corporatist government based on representatives of those
    groups.
  - A charismatic demagogue forms the nucleus of an Autocracy that abolishes the relicts
    of democratic government.
  - Passionate religious enthusiasm among the populace is responsible for the democracy's
    transformation into an eventual Theocracy.
  feudalism:
  - Anarchy! The government collapses. On a 4+ on 1d6, it is replaced by a Tribalism
    centered around individual settlements or kinship groupings. On 3 or less, zealous
    revolutionaries are successful in entrenching their own ideals; roll randomly
    on the government type table.
  - The government weathers the crisis without change.
  - A leader from among the feudal families rises to preeminence, conferring legitimacy
    on his or her descendants in a new Monarchy.
  - Ties of trade and exchange strengthen those feudal lords willing to cooperate
    over those who stand aloof, transforming them into a united Oligarchy.
  - Savage struggling among the feudal rulers eventually gives way to an Autocrat
    with legitimacy resting purely on the military or economic strength of their own
    domain.
  - Individual feudal lords prove too weak to suppress the commoners, while those
    who embrace the popular will gain the benefit of their enthusiastic support. Over
    time, these rulers are effectively chosen by the populace, forming the core of
    a new Republic.
  hydraulic_despotism:
  - Anarchy! The government collapses. On a 4+ on 1d6, it is replaced by a Tribalism

    on the government type table.
  - The government weathers the crisis without change.
  - Control over the vital resource is fragmented, no longer in the hands of a single
    controlling body. Multiple sources of the good now exist, forming the basis of
    a new Feudalism.
  - Control over the resource is lost, but the administrative and technical expertise
    of the former rulers situates them to become the Technocratic lords of the new
    government.
  - The resource is now widely available, and each individual source demands its own
    say in government, forming the interest blocs of a new Corporatism.
  - With the loss of control over the vital resource, power suddenly becomes localized
    in military strength, giving birth to a new Military Dictatorship by the strongest
    martial power.

    Feudal warlords.

    found a persistent Autocracy.
  - The oligarchy calcifies until power and prestige become based on heredity, giving

    interests, giving way to the multiple power blocs of Corporatism.
  - The oligarchy fragments as the individual participants begin to refuse to cooperate,
    leading to a Feudalism among the survivors.
  republic:
  - Anarchy! The government collapses. On a 4+ on 1d6, it is replaced by a Tribalism
    centered around individual settlements or kinship groupings. On 3 or less, zealous
    revolutionaries are successful in entrenching their own ideals; roll randomly
    on the government type table.
  - The government weathers the crisis without change.
  - Republican government becomes hopelessly deadlocked, and the bureaucracy evolves

    on the government type table.
  - The government weathers the crisis without change.
  - The technocracy gradually ceases to recruit outsiders, transforming into a closed
    Oligarchy.
  - The expertise of the technocracy is slowly absorbed under a thick layer of ritual
    and obfuscation, transforming it into a Theocracy legitimated by faith.
  - The technocrats methodically work to seize full control and technical domination
    of some resource vital to life on that world, transforming into a Hydraulic Despotism.
  - The technocrats develop close ties with individual corporations or special interest
    groups, ties that eventually absorb them into a burgeoning Corporatist state.
  theocracy:
  - Anarchy! The government collapses. On a 4+ on 1d6, it is replaced by a Tribalism

  - The government weathers the crisis without change.
  - The theocracy splinters into a Tribalism based around numerous local sects and
    hierarchies, which may or may not view each other kindly.
  - The theocracy gradually loses its religious legitimacy, becoming an Autocracy
    based on military or economic might shaded by a patina of religion.
  - Individual sects and congregations force the theocracy to divest itself of its
    autocratic power, becoming a Republic made up of representatives chosen by the
    different groups.
  - The government gradually breaks up into multiple regional hierarchs, each of whom
    maintains Feudal rights over the surrounding faithful.

  - The isolated, fractious groups fail to come together in some more complex governmental
    form.
  - The tribes make a false start at some other form of government that persists briefly
    before the guiding leaders die or the bloc that formed them collapses; roll randomly

    a Republic.
  - Individual tribal groupings form the interest blocs and corporate entities that
    congeal into a Corporatist government.
